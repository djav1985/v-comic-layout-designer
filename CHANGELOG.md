# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Stream live page updates over Server-Sent Events so any open workspace reacts immediately when `state.json` is modified.

### Changed
- Rebuilt the entire interface with a modern glassmorphism aesthetic, refreshed typography, and responsive layout cards to separate the asset library from the page builder.
- Widened the app shell and workspace grid to give the builder canvas more horizontal breathing room on large screens while keeping the layout responsive.
- Centered the shell at 90% width and standardized the page cards to two per row for a more intentional workspace rhythm on desktop screens.
- Updated the workspace page grid to use one column below 1024px, two columns up to 1980px, and three columns on ultra-wide displays while preserving panel alignment and aspect ratios.
- Locked the layout preview container to a 1.545:1 aspect ratio and removed its rounded border so spreads sit flush without white bands.

### Fixed
- Preserve diagonal panel shapes in exported images and PDFs by parsing each layout's CSS rules, caching vendor-prefixed clip-paths, and reapplying them after html2canvas renders the page.
- Keep exported PDF spreads true to their original proportions so two-up pages are no longer subtly squeezed horizontally on each sheet.
- Scale each exported layout using its captured aspect ratio so generated PDFs no longer include white bands above or below the artwork.
- Restore the classic 5.5" Ã— 8.5" workspace aspect ratio so on-screen previews and exported files fill vertically without trimming the bottom or right-hand panels.
- Eliminate duplicate PDF export constants that triggered a `pageWidth` redeclaration error in the browser console.
- Reload saved spreads directly from the persisted state file so previously authored pages render immediately after refresh.
- Treat `public/storage/state.json` as the single source of truth when rehydrating pages, removing the fallback to embedded data bundled in the HTML.
